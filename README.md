Bin Buddy is a full-stack web application that users can consult to dispose of their waste appropriately. 
Using TensorFlow and Keras to build a machine-learning model designed for computer vision and image classification. We used three layers of convolutional neural networks and training set of 200 images foor an accurate classification. We used Python Flask for the server side and back end, and we finished off the front end with HTML and CSS.
